## Concept
```
As a space or satellite enthusiast, I spend time outdoors looking into the sky and wonder "what was that bright light?"  
Or wonder "can I see a satellite tonight?" Or just curioius as to "what's flying above right now?"

I want to determine which satellites are passing by;
I want to choose my current location or that of another city;
I want to save my most recent search locations;
I want to filter my serarches by the type of satellite;
I want to know if weather conditions are favorable for a veiw.

So that I can satisfy my need for and curiousity about what is orbiting over us.
